<h1>Software Engineering API Repository</h1>
<p>This server hosts a Maven repository for the APIs created as part of CS 3733 Software Engineering, usable by
Gradle. This eliminates the need to load API jar files manually instead of through Gradle, the preferred way of
managing builds and dependencies.</p>

<h2>Using the Repository with Gradle</h2>
<p>To use the repository, add the following to your <code>repositories</code> section:</p>

<div class="center">
	<pre class="code">
<code>maven {</code>
<code>	url 'https://ravana.dyn.wpi.edu/maven'</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Gradle should then be able to download files from the server as if it were any other repository. Don't forget to
keep <code>mavenCentral()</code> in your repositories section!</p>

<p>To use an API, browse through the API listing to find the one you want, then copy the dependency string into your
	<code>dependencies</code> section. For instance, you might add the string
	<code>[group: 'd18.teamD', name: 'GiftRequest', 'version: 1.1.0']</code> in order to add D18 Team D's Gift Request
	API (version 1.1.0) to your project.</p>
