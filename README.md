Built to host APIs created as part of CS 3733 Software Engineering, at Worcester Polytechnic Institute
(WPI). As part of the course, students sometimes create Java APIs that act as pseudo-applications, which
other teams can hook into to expand the functionality of their own program. Normally, teams use the Java
build tool [Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle) to build & assemble their projects and manage
dependencies for them. Unfortunately, the requirement of using others' APIs complicates dependency
management, since each team will have to manage binary files instead of relying solely on Gradle.

This site is intended to fix that. Students can upload APIs, set info about them, include a screenshot
(if applicable), etc., and the submitted information will be published online, complete with the
addition of the uploaded .jar file to a Maven repository that Gradle can use.

#### About

Something something something Angular... Anyways, this project was created in part to help out with
the Software Engineering class, but also as an effort at self-education, since I'm not exactly the most
proficient at web development... yet.
