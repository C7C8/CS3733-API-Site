<h1>Software Engineering API Repository</h1>

<p>This server hosts a Maven repository for the APIs created as part of CS 3733 Software Engineering, usable by Gradle.
  This eliminates the need to load API jar files manually, allowing users to download and manage dependencies automatically.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use the repository, add the following to the <code>repositories</code> section in your <code>build.gradle</code>
  file:</p>

<div class="center">
<pre class="code"><code>maven {{'{'}}</code>
<code>  url '{{mavenURL}}'</code>
<code>{{ '}' }}</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Gradle should then be able to download files from the server as if it were any other repository. Don't forget to keep
  <code>mavenCentral()</code> in your repositories section!</p>

<p>To use an API, browse through the API listing to find the one you want, then copy the dependency string into your
  dependencies section. For instance, you might add the string <code>[group: 'edu.wpi.cs3733.d18.teamD', name: 'GiftRequest','version: 1.1.0']</code>
  in order to add D18 Team D's Gift Request API (version 1.1.0) to your project.</p>

<p>In order to avoid breaking teams' projects and keeping in line with other Gradle repositories, old versions of APIs
  will be stored, so once you upload a file to the repository, it's there to stay. However, only the most
  recent information about a team's API will be displayed, and "deleted" APIs won't be listed. You can check an
  API's version history for more information on their updates.</p>

<h2>Update Check API</h2>

To expose information about your API's most recent version you can use the provided
update-check API, a fully self-contained Java API that connects to this server to
grab metadata about a given API, allow users to check if your API has an update,
get a changelog, etc. To install, add <code>[group: 'edu.wpi.cs3733.util', name: 'APIUpdateChecker', version:'1.0.0']</code>
to your Gradle dependencies list and read the [very short] documentation on it
<a href="https://github.com/C7C8/SoftEng-API-UpdateChecker">here</a>.
