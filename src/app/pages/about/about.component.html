<h1>About</h1>

<p>This website was created by crmyers for the Software Engineering course (CS3733) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
  This is the second version, built using Angular and a mess of backend junk running on an ancient server I've got
  tucked away up in Atwater Kent (no, you can't use it). The original version of the site was created using simple
  static HTML and CSS, but that required manual updating every time someone wanted to upload a new API or add a new
  version to an existing one.</p>

<p>If for some reason you have a burning desire to know how this thing works, check out
  <a href="https://github.com/c7c8/SoftEng-API-Site">the source code on GitHub</a>, and
  feel free to submit pull requests! This site was created both for Software Engineering and for myself, as a
  self-education effort. The code may or may not be radioactive, so if you notice I've done something horribly wrong,
  shoot me a message!</p>

<p>For other inquiries, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:crmyers@wpi.edu">crmyers@wpi.edu</a>. Bonus points to
  people who dig up my PGP key and use it!</p>
