<p>Please select a jar file from your filesystem. File size isn't hard-limited, but large
(&gt;100 MB) files <i>will</i> catch the admin's eye - don't be the person that makes me add a limit!</p>

<p><i>If you're concerned about your file size, email me at <a href="crmyers@wpi.edu">
  crmyers@wpi.edu</a>, odds are you've done something wrong in creating your jar file and I'll
  be happy to help you out.</i></p>
